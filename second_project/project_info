FILE DESCRIPTION:
- OptitrackMap.launch: launcher file to create the map using the optitrack data.
- VisualOdomMap.launch: launcher file to create the map using the Visual Odometry data fused with IMU data.
- amcl_localization.launch: launcher file to compute and show the localization task on Rviz.
- amcl.launch.xml: xml file containing all the parameters to properly configure amcl node.
- Maps package: package containing the two maps created with optitrack data and visual odometry data.
- Rviz package: package containing configuration file to start Rviz with amcl

TF TREE:
- Optitrack launch-> used frame world and robot_1/baselink, published a transform between odom and world, and between baselink and os1_sensor with yaw offset of 3.14(published also others useful transform)
- VisualOdom launch-> used improved odom published by robot_pose_ekf and baselink, published a transoform between baselink and os1_sensor [-0.675 -0.008 +0.96], and between os1_sensor and os1_lidar
- AMCL launch-> used the same tf-tree of visualOdom launch, adding a transform between map and odom

NAME OF BAG:
- Map Creation -> 2020-05-14-16-09-36-traj1-os1-t265-pix.bag 
- Localization -> 2020-05-14-16-14-37-traj2-os1-t265-pix.bag

DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO START/USE THE NODES:
1)First you have to start the OptitrackMap.launch and then play the traj1 bag , then stop the bag at 75/270, and use the map_server map_saver to save the map.
2)Second you have to start the VisualOdomMap.launch and then play the traj1 bag again , then wait for the bag to end, and use the map_server map_saver to save the map.
3)Finally you have to play the amcl_localization.launch, rviz will open on its own and it will show the particle(that estimate the robot position) moving on the map.

ADDITIONAL INFO:
- The map used for the localization task (amcl) has to be called "VisualOdomMap".
- We have done the additional part using imu data to improve mapping and localization.
- The bag traj1 used for mapping doesn't reach the end (241/270).
- The OptiTrack map has been created by stopping the bag at (75/270).
- One of the member will graduate in July.
